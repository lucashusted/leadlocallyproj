Data information:

- final_aggregations.csv is the csv version of the file on the google drives (to create, open original and export to CSV)
- Pres_Election_data_2020_county.csv is the csv export of the County tab of the data John sent on 2020 returns (open original and export to csv)
- projects.csv was sent to us from external source.
- projects_full.csv was downloaded from https://oilandgaswatch.org/project-index (the same source, but includes projects already completed)
- state_names.txt was created by Lucas and just stores state names and abbreviations for reference.
- states_shapefiles.geojson (if here) is created in the code itself from the cb_2018 county file. No need to create again (it's the geopandas .dissolve line).
